# New Year New Me

It’s a new year once again! So many years have passed since I entered the workforce as a degree welding adult and I’m always displeased at my personal development each and every year. 

It’s rare that I make significant progress on personal projects, and if I do make progress on something it’s often proprietary. As a contractor, I constantly lose access to code of which I have contributed to significantly. When I lose access to that code, I essentially lose documentation of my own personal development. Both issues result in the same feeling every January: *Did I accomplish anything last year*?

I'm here in attempt to put a stop to this unyielding cycle. I want to motivate myself to pursue my personal projects and at the same time share knowledge I’ve gained as a professional. It's time to try something different. 

I need an outlet to express my creativity and I believe a blog will do nicely. I don’t care if you don’t care: this is for me! I will not be limiting my posts here to satiate another audience. I'll write about anything that interests me. If you find something useful here great! 

# My Goals for this year

I have high level goals that I'd like to accomplish this year. I won't be detailing these here. As I stated above, this blog is for me! I'll be keeping myself accountable with this initial post. 

- Design and manufacture at least two printed circuit boards
- Contribute to or create an open source software project
- Become moderately proficient in the design of compliant mechanisms

I'll check back in next year. Hopefully I will have completed everything!
